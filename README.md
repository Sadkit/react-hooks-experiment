# react-hooks-experiment

This is a test for React Hooks usage.

React Hooks is an experimental feature. This project uses `react-16.8.0-alpha1`.

`component.js` is a React functional component using React Hooks. React is imported directly in `index.html` via CDN, without using Babel.

*No need for npm, just open the HTML file.*
